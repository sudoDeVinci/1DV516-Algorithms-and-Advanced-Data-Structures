# Assignment 02

## Problem 01 
The double-ended queue is defined in [Deque](src/Deque.java).
The queue uses a Linked List which is defined [here](src/LinkedList.java)

## Problem 02
The randomized queue is defined in [DequeRand](src/DequeRand.java).

## Probelm 03
The LCRS directory tree is defined in [Tree LCRS](src/TreeLCRS.java).
Left or right slashes ("/" or "\") can be used for paths, but please stick to one convention.

```shell
javac src/TreeLCRS.java
java src/TreeLCRS
```

## Problem 04
The BST implementation is defined in [BST](src/BST.java).
```shell
javac src/BST.java
java src/BST
```

## Problem 05
The Isomorphic test method is the static TreeIsomorphism.isIsomorhphic() method defined in [TreeIsomorphism](src/TreeIsomorphism.java).
Time Complexity: Time complexity is O(min(m,n)*2) or O(min(m,n)) where m and n are number of nodes in given trees.
